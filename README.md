Would you like to chroot into the newly created installation?

> Yes

### Add User

- Add user

```sh
useradd -m -g wheel <your_user>
```

- Set a password for the user

```sh
passwd <your_user>
```

### Grant sudo access

As the root user, run the following command:

```sh
EDITOR=nano visudo
```

And uncomment this line so it looks like this:

```sh
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

If you don't want to enter your password every time, do this instead:

```sh
%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Log in to the newly created user:

```bash
su - your_user_name
```
### Install dotfiles

Reboot your machine and log with your user

```bash
su - your_user_name
```

Clone the repository
