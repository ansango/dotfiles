# Dotfiles

This is a collection of my dotfiles.

To my future self: remember to be simple and minimalistic. We only want to keep the essentials.

## Current OS - Debian 13 Trixie

You could install dowloading a shell script, wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansango/dotfiles/master/so/debian/install-debian.sh
